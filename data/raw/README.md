\# Raw Data (Not Committed)



The raw dataset is intentionally excluded from GitHub.



\## How to add data locally

1\. Download the dataset to your machine.

2\. Place the original files in this folder: `data/raw/`

3\. Do not rename columns unless documented in `/docs/data\_dictionary.md`.



If you fork/clone this repo, you must download the dataset separately and place it here.
